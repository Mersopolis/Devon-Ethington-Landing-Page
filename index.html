        <p>I'm a casual geek aspiring to be a professional. I love dogs. I'm happily married and living with my wife and dog in Vineyard, Utah. Since I was a young lad, I was fascinated by computers. Gaming was my biggest passion. In school, I would always excel at anything computer related, from typing and researching to spreadsheets and presentations.</p>
